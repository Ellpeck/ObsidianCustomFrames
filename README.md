# Obsidian Custom Frames
An Obsidian plugin that turns web apps into panes using iframes with custom styling. Also comes with presets for Google Keep and more.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ **For header-heavy sites like Google Keep to work, this plugin requires Obsidian 0.14.3.** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

## Usage
To use this plugin, simply go into its settings and add a new frame, either from a preset shipped with the plugin, or a custom one that you can edit yourself. Each frame's pane can be opened using the "Custom Frames: Open" command.

### On Obsidian Mobile
Unfortunately, Obsidian Mobile does not run on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), which is what allows iframes and [webviews](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/webview-tag) to be displayed with very few restrictions related to cookies, cross-origin resource sharing, and so on. This means that a lot of sites won't work there, especially ones that you have to log in to. However, when you create a frame, you can toggle the "Disable on Mobile" option to hide a Desktop-only frame in Obsidian mobile.

## Presets
By default, Custom Frames comes with a few presets that allow you to get new panes for popular sites up and running quickly.
- [Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/)
- [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com), optimized for a narrow pane on the side
- [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/day), optimized by removing some buttons. Close side panel with top-left button.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) (it's recommended to close Notion's sidebar if used as a side pane)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com)

If you create a frame that you think other people would like, don't hesitate to create a pull request with [a new preset](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianCustomFrames/blob/master/src/settings.ts#L5).

## Roadmap
- ~~Allow setting a custom icon for each pane~~
- Allow displaying custom frames in Markdown code blocks
- Allow creating links that open in a custom frame rather than the browser
- Possibly allow executing custom JavaScript in iframes (though security implications still need to be explored)

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to [lishid](https://github.com/lishid) for their help with making iframes work in Obsidian for a purpose like this. Also thanks to them for *motivating* me to turn Obsidian Keep into a more versatile plugin, which is how Custom Frames was born.
